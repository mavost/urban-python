To run the Word Count program,

    Open a terminal window such as a Windows Command Prompt.

    Change into your SPARK_HOME directory.

    Run the spark-submit utility and pass the full path to your Word Count program file as an argument.

For example, on my Windows laptop I used the following commands to run the Word Count program.

    cd %SPARK_HOME%
    bin\spark-submit c:\code\pyspark-hello-world.py
